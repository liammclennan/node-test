This command will print to stdout all the versions of packages that are

.P
To filter a single package or state, you can provide words to filter on
and highlight (if appropriate)\.  For instance, to see all the stable
packages, you could do this:

.IP "" 4
.
.nf
npm ls stable
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Another common usage is to find the set of all packages that are
